# Deploy answers and what to do

The CLI and MCP server print the server's message, plus `Next step:` and an instruction for the
agent when there is one. Follow those first. They are written for this.

| Message (start) | Code | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "This looks like source code, not a built site…" | `source_project` | Install and build (`npm install && npm run build`), then deploy the output folder it names (`dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.output/public/`). Next.js needs `output: 'export'` first. |
| "We need a folder with an index.html file…" | `no_index_html` | Upload the folder whose top level has `index.html`. Rename the main page to `index.html` if the site is a single HTML file with another name. |
| "We found more than one site (…)" | `multiple_sites_found` | Several folders each look like a site. Deploy only the one that is the finished site, from the `Folders:` list. |
| "This upload has N files and the limit is …" | `too_many_files` | Usually `node_modules` or `.git` got in. Deploy only the build folder. |
| "…too large…" | `too_large` | Make the build smaller (compress images, move video to a video host). Before a claim the cap is 25 MB, signed in it's 100 MB. |
| "We cannot host executable or archive files (…)" | `forbidden_files` | Remove `.exe .msi .apk .dmg .scr .bat .zip .rar .7z .iso` files from the site folder. |
| "This is an Express app: it runs on a server…" (or Fastify, Koa, Hono, NestJS, Remix, SvelteKit) | `server_app` | A Node server app. Host it on AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean or the user's own server (HTTPS origin, port 443, no path). Then `set_backend` (account token, hosted connector) without `site`: a new free link proxies every path to it. With a static front end on a claimed DTH site: `set_backend` with `site` proxies `/api/*` (or the `paths` you give) and needs `confirm=true` after the human says yes. SvelteKit: if no page needs the server, `@sveltejs/adapter-static` builds `build/`. |
| "This is an app that runs on a server…" / "This is an app that needs a server, and we do not run servers…" | `server_app` | The project is a server app (for example `server.js`, `app.py`). Host it on AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean or the user's own server (HTTPS origin, port 443, no path). Then `set_backend` (account token, hosted connector) without `site`: a new free link proxies every path to it. With a static front end on a claimed DTH site: `set_backend` with `site` proxies `/api/*` (or the `paths` you give) and needs `confirm=true` after the human says yes. Don't rewrite the app unless the user asks. |
| "This app runs on a server as it is…" / "This is your app's source code…" / "This is a server build of your app…" | `server_app_detected` | TanStack Start. See below. |
| "You can put 5 new sites online per hour from this network…" / "…20 new sites online per day…" | HTTP 429 | Stop creating new sites. Re-deploy from the linked folder (CLI) or pass `site` with a token instead of making another anonymous site. |
| "No DropTheHassle token set…" | (MCP) | The tool needs an account token. On npm `dropthehassle-mcp` 0.4.2 this includes `search_domain` and `whoami`. Use the hosted connector or the HTTP search in [domains.md](domains.md) for search, or ask the human for a token for account tools. Deploy still works without one. |
| "…that token is not a DropTheHassle token. This site is anonymous…" | (MCP) | `DTH_TOKEN` is a placeholder or a key from another service. The site went live anonymously. Give the human the claim link, and fix or remove the env value. |
| "The saved link is no longer valid (token revoked). Delete .dropthehassle.json and deploy again." | (CLI) | Do what it says. Note: deploying again creates a new site. To update a claimed site, use a dashboard code (`--code`) or the MCP server with a token. |
| "That code did not work…" | (CLI) | The dashboard code is single-use and lasts 15 minutes. Ask the human for a fresh one. |
| "This folder is not linked yet…" | (CLI status/rollback) | `status` and `rollback` need a folder deployed with `--login` or `--code`. After an anonymous deploy they don't work. |

## Updating a site later

- Same machine, same folder: run `npx -y dropthehassle deploy <folder>` again. `.dropthehassle.json`
  makes it update the same site.
- New machine or a cloud session (no link file): a plain deploy makes a **new** site. To update the
  claimed one, either
  - the human opens that site in the dashboard, picks **Update**, and gives you the code. Then run
    `npx -y dropthehassle deploy <folder> --code XXXX-XXXX` (valid 15 minutes, fills that site), or
  - use the MCP server with the human's token: `list_sites`, then `deploy_site` with that site
    (`site` address, or `site_id` on npm 0.4.2).
  - Or the human drops the new folder on the site in the dashboard.
- Without a token, the hosted connector always starts a new site.

## TanStack Start and new Lovable apps

Lovable apps made from 13 May 2026 onward are TanStack Start apps. They are server apps: as they
are, DTH does not run them itself. Two routes. 1) Run the whole app on AWS, Google Cloud,
DigitalOcean or the user's own server (data can stay on Supabase), then call `set_backend` without
`site` (account token, hosted connector https://dropthehassle.com/mcp): every path is proxied, so
server functions and `/api` routes work behind a DTH link. 2) A static SPA build (below), without
server functions and `/api` routes. Keeping it on Lovable is also fine. Don't split one app between
a static build and a server: that is not tested.

Get the code from GitHub first (every Lovable plan can connect to GitHub). The server's own
instruction for the agent is:

> Build this TanStack Start app as static files, without changing how it runs on Lovable. Leave
> vite.config.ts as it is. Create vite.config.dth.ts as a copy of vite.config.ts, then: add
> spa: { enabled: true } to the tanstackStart options (add tanstackStart: { spa: { enabled: true } }
> if there is none), and add nitro: false. Run npm install, then npx vite build --config
> vite.config.dth.ts. Check that dist/client/_shell.html exists. Then list every server function
> (createServerFn, files ending in .functions.ts) and every /api route, because those only work
> once the whole app runs on AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean or my own server, connected in the
> DropTheHassle Backend card, and tell me which pages use them. Tell me when dist/client is ready
> to upload.

If that build works and the pages the user needs don't rely on server functions or `/api` routes,
deploy `dist/client` and check the site in a browser. If the app relies on server functions, use
route 1 above (whole app on AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean or the user's own server plus
`set_backend`), or keep it on Lovable. Guides:

## Broken pages after a successful deploy

- **Blank page, 404s for `/src/main.tsx`**: the dev `index.html` was published. Build and deploy the
  output folder.
- **CSS/JS 404s**: the build used a sub-path base (for example Vite `base: '/repo-name/'` left over
  from GitHub Pages). The site is served at the root of its host, so set the base to `/` (or `./`)
  and rebuild.
- **Links work from the home page but a refreshed deep link 404s**: a client-side router. Check
  the URL on the live site before changing router code, and tell the user what you saw.
- **The page calls `localhost` or a dev API**: point it at the production API URL and rebuild.
